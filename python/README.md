## Installation

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Based on your use case use one this approach:

* Using client_id & client_secret:

```
python create_access_token_using_client_credentials.py
```

* Using private key:
```
python create_access_token_using_private_key.py
```

They both result in simliar access token, private key approach is more complex but you are able to rotate keys much easier
